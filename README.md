## What is Chess Lens?

Chess Lens watches your chess game through screen capture, extracts the board position using a vision model, and delivers coaching tips to a floating overlay within seconds of each move.

- **Works anywhere**: chess.com, lichess, ChessBase, or any client on screen
- **Instant engine tips**: best move and evaluation appear as soon as the engine responds
- **AI coaching**: a plain-language explanation and drill question follow in the background
- **Session history**: every game saved locally; browse past sessions and replay the analysis

---

## Installation

**macOS / Linux**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://artifacts.videodb.io/chess-lens/install | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**
```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/video-db/chess-lens/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

Then start the app:

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Automatic board detection** | Reads any chess board from a screenshot, white or black perspective |
| **Two-stage coaching** | Engine tip shown instantly; LLM explanation upgrades it in the background |
| **Floating HUD** | Transparent always-on-top overlay with board, tip, and drill question. Draggable. |
| **Session history** | Browse past games and review coaching tips |
| **Post-session summary** | AI-generated recap after each game |
| **Local-first** | All data stored on your machine. Only API calls leave the device. |

## How It Works

```
Screenshot (every second)
    ↓
Vision model -> board position (FEN)
    ↓
Chess engine -> best move + evaluation
    ↓
Instant tip shown in overlay
    ↓
LLM coaching explanation (background) -> overlay upgrades
```

A new tip fires only when the board position changes, exactly one tip per move.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- VideoDB API key: [console.videodb.io](https://console.videodb.io)
- macOS 12+: grant Screen Recording in System Settings > Privacy & Security

### Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build

```bash
npm run dist:mac    # macOS DMG
npm run dist        # all platforms
```

## Repository Layout

- `src/`: application source for Electron main, preload, renderer, shared types, and widget code
- `test/`: unit tests, mirroring the source tree without the `src/` prefix
- `test-data/`: smoke-test fixtures and sample frames
- `tools/`: validation, diagnostics, maintenance, and asset-generation scripts
- `scripts/`: install and local launch helper scripts
- `assets/`: runtime model files packaged with the app
- `resources/`: app icons and packaged resources
- `docs/`: development notes that do not need to live at the root

Generated folders such as `dist/`, `release/`, `drizzle/`, Storybook output, logs, and benchmark result files are ignored and can be regenerated.

---

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>No coaching tips appearing</strong></summary>

- Confirm Screen Recording permission is granted in System Settings > Privacy & Security
- Make sure the chess board is fully visible and not covered by other windows
- The first tip takes 5-10 seconds on a new position
- Check logs at `~/Library/Application Support/chess-lens/logs/`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>FEN extraction always null</strong></summary>

- The board must be clearly visible and at least ~400 px wide
- No overlays or modals should cover the board during capture
- Run `npm run tools:check-model` to verify the vision model is reachable

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Native module errors after install</strong></summary>

```bash
npm run rebuild
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>App won't start</strong></summary>

- Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed
- Delete `dist/` and re-run `npm run dev`
- Check that port 5174 is not already in use

</details>
